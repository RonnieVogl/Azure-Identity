# Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication

This section describes design considerations and proven practices when implementing Multi-Factor Authentication.

Two-stage verification is an authentication method requiring end users to implement a second layer of verification upon sign-ins. 

Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is Microsoft's two-step verification solution. Azure MFA provides a range of verification methods that include phone call, text message or mobile app verification. Use one of the following two methods to implement MFA:
	1. MFA in the Cloud
	2. MFA on-premises



Guidance Use the following as guidelines when implementing MFA:

	• Ensure you have licenses for Azure MFA, Azure AD Premium or Enterprise Mobility and Security. If you do not have licenses, create an Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Provider to take full advantage of the features provided by Azure MFA. Review  the following guides on how to create and manage an MFA provider: 
		○  Create an MFA Provider 
		○  Manage your MFA Provider
	
	• Review and Identify your organization's identity and security compliance policies as it relates to authentication and MFA.

	• Before choosing a method to implement MFA, review the following to determine your solution requirements:
		○ What am I trying to Secure?
		○ Where Are The Users Located?
		○ What Features Do I Need?
	
	• Review the following to understand security best practices:
		○ Deploy MFA to the Cloud
		○ Best Practices for an On-premises Deployment
		
	• As a part of the deployment consider the following:
		○ Configure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication settings
		○ Configure Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server for High Availability
		○ Securing Cloud Resources with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication and AD FS
