# Implementing Azure AD Connect Server

Use the mandatory procedure described in this section to install and configure Azure AD Connect. 
Use Azure AD Connect to synchronize your on-premise directories with the Azure Active Directory. Once the directories are synchronized, end-users can seamlessly access both cloud and on-premises resources.  



Guidance
Use the following supplemental information when performing this procedure:
	•  If you expect your database to be larger than 10GB or you have more than 100K objects in AD, use SQL standard or enterprise (not SQL express).
	• Use at least two Azure AD Connect servers:  One is the active server,  the other is operating in staging mode. 
	• Do not co-host Azure AD connect server with other Sync engines on the same server (such as FIM/MIM).



Preparation Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 
	1. Download Azure AD Connect. Access the Azure Connect software download center:  Azure AD Connect.
	
	2. Complete the prerequisite steps using the procedure described in: Prerequisites for Azure AD Connect.  
	
	3. Download Azure AD Connect (Version 1.1.486.0 or later). 
	
	4. Obtain the required accounts and permissions. Refer to:  Azure AD Connect: Accounts and permissions. 
	
	5. If you already have AD FS implemented on-premises, use the custom installation of Azure AD Connect. Follow the steps described in: Configuring federation with AD FS.
	
	6. If you have ADFS implemented on Windows Server 2012 and want to upgrade to Windows Server 2016, use the following guide:  Upgrade to AD FS in Windows Server 2016 with SQL Server.
	
	7. Configure your firewall to connect to Office 365, see: Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges.
	
	8. If you have an existing Azure AD tenant, refer to: Azure AD Connect: When you have an existent tenant.
	
	9. Review Supported Topologies for Azure AD connect Server. 


Procedure:  How to install and configure Azure AD Connect

Once you download AzureADConnect.msi as instructed in the preparation, navigate to the download folder, locate the .msi file, right-click it and select: “run as administrator”.
	
	2. Perform a custom installation
	Follow the steps to Install using Custom settings (Recommended):  Custom installation of Azure AD Connect.
	
	3. Verify Azure AD Connect is installed correctly
	Once Azure AD Connect is installed, verify the installation and assign licenses. See: Next steps and how to manage Azure AD Connect.
