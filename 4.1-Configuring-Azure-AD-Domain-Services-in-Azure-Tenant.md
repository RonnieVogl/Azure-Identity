# Configuring Azure AD Domain Services in Azure Tenant


Use the information in this section as guidance when configuring Azure AD Domain Services (AAD-DS) in Azure Tenant.

Azure AD DS provides managed domain services such as: domain join, group policy and Kerberos/NTLM authentication without the need for you to deploy, manage, and patch domain controllers in the cloud. Azure AD Domain Services integrates with your existing Azure AD tenant, thus making it possible for users to log in using their corporate credentials. Additionally, you can use existing groups and user accounts to secure access to resources, thus ensuring a smoother 'lift-and-shift' of on-premises resources to Azure Infrastructure Services.
Azure AD Domain Services functionality works seamlessly regardless of whether your Azure AD tenant is cloud-only or synced with your on-premises Active Directory.


Use the following supplemental information to determine the suitability of this pattern.


Table:
Advantages	Disadvantages
Simple:	AAD-DS requires password hash synchronization. 
No need to deploy and manage identity infrastructure in Azure or setup connectivity back to your on-premises identity infrastructure.	
	Due to security compliance standards, some organizations will not implement password hash synchronization.
Integrated:	Domain or Enterprise administrator privileges are not offered on an AAD-DS Services managed domain. 
Azure AD Domain Services is deeply integrated with your Azure AD tenant. Use Azure AD as an integrated cloud-based enterprise directory to cater to the needs of both modern applications and traditional directory-aware applications.	
	Applications that require these elevated privileges cannot be deployed against AAD-DS managed domains.
Compatible: 	You cannot extend the base schema of an Azure AD Domain Services managed domain. 
Available features on Azure AD DS are compatible with the corresponding Windows Server AD features you rely on in your on-premises infrastructure. 	
	Applications that rely on extensions to AD schema (for example, new attributes under the user object) cannot be lifted and shifted to AAD-DS domains.
The LDAP, Kerberos, NTLM, Group Policy, and domain join capabilities and constitute a mature offering refined over various Windows Server releases.
Cost-effective:	The managed domain is read-only for user objects. 
Avoid the infrastructure and management burden associated with managing identity infrastructure to support traditional directory-aware applications. 	
	Applications that perform LDAP write operations against attributes of the user object do not work in a managed domain. 
You can move these applications to Azure Infrastructure Services and benefit from greater savings on operational expenses.	
	User passwords cannot be changed from within the managed domain. 
	
	Modification of group memberships or group attributes within the managed domain is not permitted. However, any changes to user attributes or passwords made in Azure AD (via PowerShell/Azure portal) or on-premises AD are synchronized to the AAD-DS managed domain.
	Managed domains cannot be configured to set up trust relationships (inbound/outbound) with other domains. 
	
	Resource forest deployment scenarios cannot use Azure AD Domain Services. Similarly, deployments where you prefer not to synchronize passwords to Azure AD cannot use Azure AD Domain Services.
	Azure AD Domain Services managed domains are available in a single virtual network in Azure. 
	
	For scenarios that require domain controllers to be available in multiple Azure regions across the world, setting up domain controllers in Azure IaaS VMs might be the better alternative.


Guidance
	• Review and Identify objects and identities you wish to synchronize to Azure AD Domain Services
	
	• Ensure that you have Azure AD Connect installed and configured for the synchronization process
	
	• Ensure that you have the correct licenses on Azure prior to configured Azure AD Domain Services
	
	• Ensure that password hash synchronization is enabled on your on-premise AD Domain Services prior to synchronizing identities and objects. Password synchronization is mandatory for organizations who wish to use Azure AD Domain Services. This requirement is because users' credentials are needed in the managed domain provided by Azure AD Domain Services, to authenticate these users via NTLM or Kerberos authentication methods.
