# Extending On-Premise AD Domain Services (AD DS) to Azure

Use the information in this section as guidance when planning to extend on-premises AD Domain Services to Azure.

Organizations who have applications that need to be hosted partly on-premises and partly in Azure may need to extend their on-premise AD network to the Azure virtual network.

One way to accomplish this is creating a VPN tunnel (I.e. Site-to-Site) between your on-premise network and your Azure virtual network. Then extending your existing on-premises Active Directory infrastructure to Azure, by deploying virtual machines that host AD DS in Azure and join the virtual machines to your on-premises AD forest.

Advantages	Disadvantages
Provides access to the same identity information that is available on-premises.	You must deploy and manage your own AD DS servers and domain in the cloud.
You can authenticate user, service, and computer accounts on-premises and in Azure.	You will need to manage, secure, patch, monitor, backup, and troubleshoot these virtual machines
You don't need to manage a separate AD forest. The domain in Azure can belong to the on-premises forest.	There may be some synchronization latency between the domain servers in the cloud and the servers running on-premises.
You can apply group policy defined by on-premises Group Policy Objects to the domain in Azure.	
	
	


Guidance
Use the following supplemental information.

	1. Ensure that you have a VPN tunnel (I.e. Site-to-Site) configured and in place prior to extending your on-premise infrastructure over to Azure. 
	
	2. Ensure that the DNS is configured on the Azure virtual network to ensure there is connectivity between your organizations on-premise network and your Azure virtual network
	
	3. Follow the following recommendations for designing the architecture and infrastructure:
		○ Recommendations on Architecture
		○ Recommendations on Virtual Machines, Networking, Active Directory Site, Monitoring
