# Securing Azure AD Privileged Identities


This section describes design considerations and proven practices when securing Azure AD privileged identities.

For further information on Privileged Accounts, see:  What is Azure AD Privileged Identity Management?



Guidance
Use the following as guidelines when applying governance to privileged accounts:
	
	• Do not use generic accounts because there is no accountability or traceability to person and it can be shared
	
	• Create separate accounts for Privileged role members and name them accordingly (e.g. GA-Admin-JSmith for Global Admins)
	
	• Have a minimum of two and a maximum of five subscription owners (service admins and co-admins) to prevent collusion while preventing admin sprawl
	
	• Ensure the admin accounts you select are managed accounts. i.e. Corporate accounts that are within your Azure AD Tenant or Synced from On-premise AD.
	
	• Ensure Admin Accounts can only be accessed via an enforceable, automated workflow approval process which requires an approver who is different from the requestor.
	
	• Ensure privileged role assignment is not assigned permanently but on a just in time basis.
	
	• Enforce Multi-Factor authentication and risk-based conditional access on admin accounts.
	
	• Implement Azure AD PIM (privileged Identity Management) across Admin Accounts and privileged azure roles to enforce just-in-time administration.
	
	• Implement Periodic (Quarterly) Admin Account Access Review to re-certify who should continue to have access to admin and should be different from the Role Owner.
	
	• Monitor via real-time alerts when members are added or removed from privilege roles.
	 
	• Enable > Medium Risk Conditional Policy rule using Azure AD Identity Protection to protect Admin Accounts (based on privileged account members belonging to an Azure AD Group).
	
	• Configure Conditional Access Policy to ensure privileged accounts can only logging from trusted networks.
	
	• Use a Hardened Admin Workstation when logging on with privileged accounts to Azure.


Use the following as design consideration guidelines:

	• Azure AD PIM (privileged Identity Management) requires Azure AD premium P2 licenses or EMS (Enterprise Mobility Suite) E5 licenses. 
	
	• Azure AD Identity Protection requires Azure AD premium P2 licenses or EMS (Enterprise Mobility Suite) E5 licenses. 
	
	• Compare Azure Active directory editions
