Use the information in the table below to determine the most appropriate Azure AD implementation pattern based on your authentication needs.

Table: Grab from Security doc?

Consideration	ADFS	Pass-through Authentication with SSO 	Password Hash Synchronization (with SSO)
	See: Implementing AD FS Server for Azure AD	See: Implementing Pass-Through Authentication	See: Implementing Password Hash Synchronization
Where does the authentication happen?	On-premises	On-premises	In the cloud 
		
		
Where does the user enter the credentials?	On-premises 	In the cloud 	In the cloud
	Through proxy in DMZ	Transmitted securely to on-premises agent
